# Alex Oxorn

## Welcome to my World!
Hello there! I'm Alex Oxorn, born in 1997 and raised in the vibrant city of Montreal, Canada. I may wear many hats, but here are a few things that define me most prominently:

## Gaming Enthusiast 🎮
I have a soft spot for the imaginative and captivating world of video games, especially those from Japan. Nintendo games, JRPGs, and the adrenaline-fueled experience of Sonic Adventure 2 hold a special place in my gaming heart. If you ever want to talk strategies, game lore, or just share the joy of gaming, I'm your person!

## Code Connoisseur 💻
C++ is my language of choice in the vast realm of programming. The low-level intricacies and the power to sculpt complex constructs keep me hooked. I've tinkered with various projects, including a tool that reads a game's process and generates dynamic graphical representations during gameplay. I thrive on the marriage of manual control and higher-level abstraction that C++ offers.

## Problem Solver Master 🧠
Introverted by nature, I find solace in the logical realms of problem-solving. Completing the Advent of Code challenges for both 2021 and 2022 was a satisfying feat, a testament to my love for tackling intricate puzzles and logical challenges.

## Sharing Interest With the World 🌐
There are many cool and interesting ideas in both the realm of games and programming, and I want to share that intrigue with the world. Join me as I talk about some of the what I have to share with the rest of the world

Cheers,
Alex Oxorn
